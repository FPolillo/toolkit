# Running the Cylera task

Cylera provides security, operations, network and clinical data in real time. Use this toolkit task to get data from Cylera.

**Note:** For more information about toolkits and how to use them, see the [README](../../../README.md).

To run this task, you require the following **Cylera** information:

1. Instance hostname
2. API user email
3. API user password

## Incremental runs

The Cylera task supports incremental runs. Use them to improve performance and pull only the latest changes rather than pulling all available assets and vulnerabilities every time. Currently you cannot determine exactly which last_seen_after parameter was used for the previous run. So, the incremental run pulls data for one (1) additional day, expecting that pulling data from Cylera takes less then 1 day.

**Enabling Incremental runs**

To enable incremental runs, use the following parameters:

1. **incremental=true:** When enabled, the connector uses `last_connector_run_start_time`-`1 day` as value for `cylera_last_seen_after`

2. **cylera_last_seen_after:** Use it only on the first run, while the following runs are using `last_connector_run_start_time`-`1 day`


**Note:** To improve efficiency, automate this process with a scheduling tool of your choice.

## Command Line

For this task, you can leave off the Kenna API key and Kenna connector ID, so the task creates a .json file in the default or specified output directory. You can then review the file before you upload it directly to Cisco Vulnerability Management.

### Recommended Steps

1. Initially, run it with **Cylera keys** only.
2. Review the output .json file to ensure you got the data you expected.
3. Create the Kenna Data Importer connector in Cisco Vulnerability Management. You could name it **Cylera KDI**, for example.
4. Upload the .json file to your connector and run it to verify there are no import errors and you can view Cylera data in Cisco VM.
5. Click the connector name and copy the connector's ID.
6. Run the task with **Cylera keys**, your **Kenna API key** and the **connector ID** to extract data from Cylera, upload it to Cisco, and import it all in one command.
